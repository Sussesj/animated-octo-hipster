###Emphasis: 
Development. 

###Requirement: 
Design 

Just because we have a code class, doesn't mean we leave design behind the door. Not expecting this (http://24hoursofhappy.com/), but definitely not (http://www.hyperbubble.net/index.html) this either. Although I see the humorous kitsch aesthetic value in something like (http://heaven.internetarchaeology.org/heaven.html) if bad design is part of the concept. 

###Every session:
We learn something about nuts and bolts of javascript, and something useful you can immediately start using to help you with projects. Time remaining?  we can workshop.

###Assignments:
* [almost]1 mini-assignment per week.
* mid term.
* final.
